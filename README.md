## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

This project was to build a calculator with two n umber inputs,
four buttons for operators, and a equals button to get the result.
Once equals is pressed the inputs along with which operator button was pressed is sent to the server. This is where the calculation is done.
Once the answer is calculated on the server it is sent back to the client where it is posted to the DOM.
A history of all calculations done is kept on the dom with an emphasis on the most recent answer.
There is a button to clear all calculation history which empties the array of calculation objects sent on the server sending back an empty array. 
This project uses html, css, javascript, bootstrap, jQuery, nodejs and ajax.
